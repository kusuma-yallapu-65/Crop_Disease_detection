# Crop_Disease_detection
Crop diseases pose a major threat to agricultural productivity, resulting in economic losses and food insecurity. This project focuses on developing an advanced image classification model using deep learning to detect crop diseases efficiently. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model analyzes plant leaf images and accurately classifies them into various disease categories. A comprehensive dataset of healthy and diseased plants is used for training and validation. This automated approach empowers farmers with early disease detection, enabling prompt action to mitigate damage. Future enhancements include expanding dataset diversity, refining model accuracy, and incorporating drone-based monitoring for large-scale analysis.
